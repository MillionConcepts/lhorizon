    "# lhorizon example 1: where was GALEX in May 2003?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are examining a portion of the observational data record of the GALEX space telescope from May 2003 and you realize that there is an anomaly that might be explicable by a barycentric time offset. A SPK SPICE kernel for GALEX may exist somewhere, but you do not know where. Horizons contains detailed information about the positions of many orbital and ground intrument platforms, and ```lhorizon``` can help you quickly figure out where GALEX was during this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a relatively short time period at relatively coarse resolution. If you realize that you need higher resolution or if you'd like to do larger queries -- ones with more than about 70K rows -- take a look at the bulk query functions in mars_sun_angle.ipynb."
