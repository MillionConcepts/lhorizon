class LHorizon:
    """
    JPL HORIZONS interface object, the core class of `lhorizon`.

    ### Parameters
        target: Union[int, str, MutableMapping] = "301",
        origin: Union[int, str, MutableMapping] = "500@399",
        epochs: Optional[Union[str, float, Sequence[float], Mapping]] = None,
        session: Optional[requests.Session] = None
    #### target: Union[int, str, MutableMapping] = "301"

    Name, number, or designation of the object to be queried. the Moon
    is used if no target is passed. Arbitrary topocentric coordinates
    can also be provided in a dict, like:
    ```python
    {
        'lon': longitude in deg,
        'lat': latitude in deg (North positive, South negative),
        'elevation': elevation in km above the reference ellipsoid,
        ['body': Horizons body ID of the central body; optional;
        Earth is used if it is not provided.]
    }.
    ```
    Horizons must possess a rotational model and reference ellipsoid
    for the central body in order to process topocentric queries --
    don't expect this to work with artificial satellites or most small
    bodies, for instance.  Also note that Horizons always treats
    west-longitude as positive for prograde bodies and east-longitude
    as positive for retrograde bodies, with the very notable
    exceptions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun; despite the fact that they
    are prograde, it treats east-longitude as positive on these three
    bodies.

    #### origin: Union[int, str, MutableMapping] = "500@399"
    Coordinate origin (representing central body or observer location).
    Uses the same codes as JPL Horizons -- in some cases, text will
    work, in some cases it will not. If no location is provided,
    Earth's center is used. Arbitrary topocentic coordinates can also
    be given as a dict, in the same format as the target parameter.
    #### epochs: Optional[Union[str, float, Sequence[float], Mapping]]
    Either a scalar in any astropy.time - parsable format,
    a list of epochs in jd, iso, or dt format, or a dict
    defining a range of times and dates. Timescale is UTC for OBSERVER
    queries and TDB for VECTORS queries. If no epochs are provided,
    the current time is used. Scalars or range dictionaries are
    preferred over lists, as they tend to be processed more easily by
    Horizons. The range dictionary format is:
    ```python
    {
        'start':'YYYY-MM-DD [HH:MM:SS.fff]',
        'stop':'YYYY-MM-DD [HH:MM:SS.fff]',
        'step':'n[y|d|h|m]'
    }
    ```
    If no units are provided for `step`, Horizons evenly divides the
    period between `start` and `stop` into n intervals.
    #### session: Optional[requests.Session]
    session object for optimizing API calls. A new session is generated
    if one is not passed.
    #### allow_long_queries: bool = False
    if True, allows long (>2000 character) URLs to be used to query
    JPL Horizons. These will often be truncated serverside, resulting
    in unexpected output, and so are not allowed by default.
    #### query_options: dict, optional
    lower-level options passed to JPL Horizons. not all of these options are
    meaningful for all queries. See JPL documentation for fuller descriptions
    of some of these options. allowed keys and value types are:
    * `airmass_lessthan: int` cuts off points with airmass > value
    * `solar_elongation: Sequence[int]` e.g. `(30, 60)` suppresses times at
    which angular separation between Sun and target in degrees exceeds this
    value
    * `max_hour_angle: float` suppresses times at which local hour angle at
    Earth topocentric location exceeds this value in angular hours
    * `rate_cutoff: float` suppresses times at which observer-target relative
    rate in arcseconds/hour exceeds this value
    * `skip_daylight: bool = False` suppresses times at which Sun is visible
    from observer
    * `refraction: bool = False` apply correction for atmospheric refraction
    (Earth sites only)
    * `refsystem: str = "J2000"` base coordinate reference system. default is
    "J2000", Earth mean equator and equinox of January 1 2000,
    closely aligned with ICRF and equivalent to SPICE "J2000'. Can also be
    "B1950", FK5 / Earth mean equator of 1950.
    * `quantities: str` Horizons quantity codes, expressed as a
    comma-separated string. defaults for each query type
    can be set in `lhorizon.config`. See JPL documentation for a full list of
    code. "A" will return all available quantities.
    * `extra_precision: bool=False`: return full available precision for
    RA/Dec values in OBSERVER tables

    ### attributes

    All parameters are also accessible class attributes. However, we do
    not suggest that users modify target, origin, epochs, or query_type after
    initialization. If session, query_options, or allow_long_queries are
    modified, `lhorizon.prepare_request()` must be called in order for changes
    to these attributes to affect subsequent queries to JPL Horizons.

    #### request
    `request.PreparedRequest` object: request for JPL Horizons.

    #### response
    `requests.response` objects: response from JPL Horizons. Examining
    `lhorizon.response.content` is a DIY alternative to using the
    `lhorizon.table()` or `lhorizon.dataframe()` methods.
